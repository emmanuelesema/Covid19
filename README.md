# Covid19

This project was inspired by the outbreak of the corona virus in 2020 which forced people to isolate in their homes and reduce all forms of physical
contact with others outside your household. 

Thus the goal of the project was to create a prototype of what will occur in Norway if certain factors were altered and visualize the effects using graphs!

Below is the meaning of the abbreviations used in this project:

S: Susceptible – who can get the disease

I: Infected – who have developed the disease and symptomatic (can infect susceptible and show symptoms).

Ia: infected – who have developed the disease and are asymptomatic (show no symptoms)

E1: Exposed – who are exposed and non-infectious

E2: Exposed – who are exposed and infectious

R: Recovered – who have recovered and become immune

The scale of infectiousness of people in Ia [r_ia] = 1/(r_ia) : 0.1 

The scale of infectiousness of people in E2 [r_e2] = 1/(r_e2): 1.25 

The mean duration of the non-infectious incubation period [lmbda_1] = 1/(lmbda_1): 0.33 days^-1
(Incubation period is the time elapsed between exposure to a pathogenic organism a chemical, or radiation, and when symptoms and sign are first apparent)

The mean duration of E2 phase [lmbda_2] = 1/(lmbda_2): 0.5 days^-1

Proportion of infected people that never develop symptoms [p_a] = 0.4

the mean duration of I phase [mu (µ)] = 1/µ: 0.2 days^-1

infection rate [beta (ß)]: 0.5

average recovery time for the disease [v (nu)] = 1/(v ): v days^-1

mean time of immunity [gamma] = 1/gamma: g days^-1
